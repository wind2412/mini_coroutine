# A toy coroutine for fun

Only a toy to present the principle of coroutine. It's flavor is some what like lua coroutine... (but without arguments, very very simple but I would like to add it some other day)

# Play:
Maybe on linux only (mac cannot link. windows I dont know).
```
g++ -std=c++11 -g switch_to.S simple_coro.cc -o simple_coro
./simple_coro
```
